          Together with my co-author Dennis Verhoeven, we estimate the impact of
          air pollution on the aggregated inventive output in Europe. Existing
          estimates of the economic costs of air pollution do not account for
          its effect on inventive output. However, estimating the causal impact
          of air pollution on innovation is complex due to many unobserved
          factors that are correlated with region’s economy and pollution. For
          instance, regions with a high economic activity (including innovation)
          produce high levels of air pollution. Thus, simply regressing regions
          air pollution levels on its inventive outcomes would lead to an
          underestimation of the negative effects of air pollution on
          innovation. To mitigate such concerns, we estimate an instrumental
          variable regression exploiting two weather phenomena that induce
          random variation in air pollution. Our estimation reveals that a
          decrease in exposure to small particulate matter of 0.17 µg/m3 -- the
          average yearly reduction in Europe -- leads to 1.7% more patented
          inventions. This increase in the inventive output corresponds to a
          value of 21.3 billion euro.

          Deregulation of capital requirements does not only lead to an increase
          in entrepreneurship, it also entails a substantial substitution effect
          where entrepreneurs are more likely to opt for a legal form with low
          instead of high paid-in capital. In this paper, we show that firms
          that choose for a limited liability company with low paid-in capital
          experience a lower access to debt financing compared to their high
          paid-in capital counterparts. These findings are robust to using
          different estimation techniques, including a difference-in-difference
          and regression discontinuity design. Our findings are consistent with
          the idea that credit providers use the entrepreneur’s legal form
          choice as a screening device to sort out perceived high-risk firms
          from low-risk firms. Our findings contribute to a more nuanced
          understanding of the impact of deregulation of capital requirements on
          newly established firms.

          In this project we investigate how intangible capital in form of
          intellectual property, such as patents, might mitigate financing
          constraints. While scholars have already argued that patents might
          have a signalling value reducing information asymmetries between
          borrowers and lenders, we quantify the value of using patents as
          collateral with regard to capital access. Although this mechanism of
          patents in financing further R&D is not new, we are the first to
          provide a treatment effects study of patent collateral and access to
          capital. We make use of mandatory collateral registry data in Sweden
          and the Netherlands to construct panels combining firm-level financial
          data and patent measures. Estimating conditional
          difference-in-difference regressions on firms’ debt allows deducting
          treatment effects of using patents as collateral. We find that patent
          pledging enables Swedish (Dutch) firms to borrow about 21% (26%) more
          than in the counterfactual situation in which no patents would have
          been used as collateral. We also find that the collateral value of
          patents is higher than their signalling value, and a
          back-of-the-envelope scenario calculation shows that Dutch (Swedish)
          firms could raise more than € 7 (€ 10) billion additional debt capital
          if the complete patent portfolios would be pledged, all else constant.
